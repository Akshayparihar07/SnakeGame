# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game allows the player to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. **Controls:**
   - Up Arrow: Move the snake up
   - Down Arrow: Move the snake down
   - Left Arrow: Move the snake left
   - Right Arrow: Move the snake right

2. **Game Rules:**
   - The snake will continue moving in its current direction until a new direction is input.
   - The snake grows longer each time it eats food, increasing the score.
   - Colliding with the walls or the snake's own body ends the game.
   - The goal is to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
- **Food:** Randomly generated food items for the snake to eat and grow.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the player's score and high score.
- **Game Over Handling:** Proper handling of game over situations with a brief pause before restarting.
- **Graphics:** Simple graphics using Turtle library for a visual gaming experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the script using the command: `python main.py`.

## Acknowledgments

This Snake Game project was created as a simple implementation for learning Python and basic game development concepts. Feel free to modify and enhance it according to your preferences.

**Note:** The code includes an infinite loop for the game, so you may need to manually close the window to exit the game.

Have fun playing the Snake Game! üêçüéÆ
